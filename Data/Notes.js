I was intrigued by the idea of a city girl going to a small town to save her twin sister only to end up taking care of her niece instead. This book took me on a roller coaster of emotions, and you know what? I would do it all over again.",

But if one of my favorite authors decides to write a small-town romance featuring a grumpy single dad and the nanny he hired for the summer â€” well, what do you expect me to do? I'm going to read it immediately. It's that simple: Elsie Silver writes a book, and I buy it.",
